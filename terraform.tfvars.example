# Terraform Stack Variables Example
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize for your deployments

# Project name - used in resource naming
# project_name = "my-company-stack"

# Default instance type across deployments  
# instance_type = "t3.small"

# VPC CIDR blocks for different deployments
# Uncomment and modify if you want to override defaults
# vpc_cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
# subnet_cidr = "10.0.1.0/24"

# SSH access restrictions
# For development, you might allow broader access:
# allowed_ssh_cidrs = ["0.0.0.0/0"]

# For production, restrict to specific networks:
# allowed_ssh_cidrs = ["10.0.0.0/8", "192.168.0.0/16"]

# Or restrict to your specific IP:
# allowed_ssh_cidrs = ["YOUR.IP.ADDRESS/32"]

# Note: These variables are defined in components.tfstack.hcl and can be
# overridden per deployment in deployments.tfdeploy.hcl or globally here.
